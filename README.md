<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project analyzes Diwali sales data to uncover customer purchasing behavior and key business trends. A complete analytics workflow was developed using Python for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to identify high-performing product categories, customer segments, and regional sales patterns, enabling data-driven marketing and inventory strategies.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="project-learning"></a>project-learning</h2>

- Performed data cleaning and manipulation

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries

- Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups

- Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>Dataset</h2>

- Format: CSV

- Rows: ~11,000

- Columns: Customer details, gender, age group, product category, amount spent, city tier, etc.

- Perfect for: EDA, customer segmentation, and visualization

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Loaded the Diwali Sales dataset using Pandas for inspection and preprocessing.

- Handled missing values by removing null entries and correcting inconsistent data

- Filtered out invalid entries, such as customers with zero or negative purchase amounts.

- Created new columns for deeper insights (e.g., total purchase by gender, age group, or state).

---
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

- **Analyzed customer demographics** such as gender, age group, state, and occupation to identify key buyer segments.

- **Examined purchasing behavior** by comparing total sales across different product categories and regions.

- Identified top-performing categories and customer segments contributing most to revenue.

- **Visualized trends** using charts like bar plots, histograms, and pie charts created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- **Observed correlations** between demographic factors and purchase amount to understand sales drivers.

- **Derived insights** such as higher spending by married women in the 26â€“35 age group and top sales in metropolitan areas.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="research-questions--key-findings"></a>Research Questions & Key Findings</h2>

**Research Questions:**
- Which **gender** contributes the most to overall sales?

- What are the **top-performing states** in terms of total sales?

- Which **occupation types** spend the most during Diwali?

- Which **product categories** generate the highest revenue?

**Key Findings:**
- **Female customers** made more purchases and contributed more to total sales than males.

- The **26â€“35 age group** showed the highest spending behavior.

- **IT and Healthcare** professionals were among the top spenders.

- **Top states** such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka had the highest sales volume.
