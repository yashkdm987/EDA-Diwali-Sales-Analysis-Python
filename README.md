<h2><a class="anchor" id="project-learning"></a>project-learning</h2>

- Performed data cleaning and manipulation

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries

- Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups

- Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Loaded the Diwali Sales dataset using Pandas for inspection and preprocessing.

- Handled missing values by removing null entries and correcting inconsistent data

- Filtered out invalid entries, such as customers with zero or negative purchase amounts.

- Created new columns for deeper insights (e.g., total purchase by gender, age group, or state).

---
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

- **Analyzed customer demographics** such as gender, age group, state, and occupation to identify key buyer segments.

- Examined purchasing behavior by comparing total sales across different product categories and regions.

- Identified top-performing categories and customer segments contributing most to revenue.

- Visualized trends using charts like bar plots, histograms, and pie charts created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- Observed correlations between demographic factors and purchase amount to understand sales drivers.

- Derived insights such as higher spending by married women in the 26â€“35 age group and top sales in metropolitan areas.
